[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/Stack64MC/NoName/gradle.yml)]()

NoName is a fork of the [PaperMC Team's Velocity proxy](https://papermc.io/software/velocity), built to handle Stack64's needs.

If you aren't using Stack64, please use the [original Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity).
